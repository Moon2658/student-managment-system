```

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moon2658/student-managment-system
   cd student-managment-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command runs both the JSON Server (port 3001) and React development server (port 5173) concurrently.

### Alternative: Run servers separately

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start JSON Server
npm run server

# Terminal 2: Start React development server
npm run dev
```

## 📊 Business Constraints

### 1. GPA Validation

- **Rule**: GPA must be between 0.0 and 4.0
- **Implementation**: Form validation with real-time feedback
- **UI Logic**: Color-coded GPA badges (Green: ≥3.5, Yellow: ≥3.0, Blue: ≥2.5, Red: <2.5)

### 2. Department Requirement

- **Rule**: Department field cannot be empty
- **Implementation**: Required field validation with dropdown selection
- **UI Logic**: Pre-defined department list to ensure consistency

### 3. Unique Constraints

- **Rule**: Email and Roll Number must be unique across all students
- **Implementation**: Real-time validation against existing records
- **UI Logic**: Immediate feedback on duplicate detection

### 4. Age Validation

- **Rule**: Student age must be between 16 and 60 years
- **Implementation**: Date of birth validation with age calculation
- **UI Logic**: Automatic age calculation display

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern Bootstrap Theme**: Clean and professional appearance
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, loading states, and animations
- **Color-coded Status**: Visual indicators for GPA performance levels
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced filtering capabilities with clear results
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive feedback for user actions

## 🔧 API Endpoints

The JSON Server provides RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /students` - Fetch all students
- `GET /students/:id` - Fetch specific student
- `POST /students` - Create new student
- `PUT /students/:id` - Update student
- `DELETE /students/:id` - Delete student

## 📱 Application Pages

### 1. Home Dashboard (`/`)

- Student statistics overview
- Top performers
- Department distribution
- Quick action buttons

### 2. Student List (`/students`)

- Paginated student table
- Department and GPA filters
- Multi-field search
- Bulk actions

### 3. Add Student (`/add-student`)

### 4. Edit Student (`/edit-student/:id`)

- Pre-populated form
- Same validation as add form
- Unique constraint checking

### 5. Student Detail (`/student/:id`)

- Academic performance overview
- Quick edit/delete actions

## 📋 Testing Scenarios
